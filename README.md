# Spicetify Local API
Made as an alternative to using spotifys web API that lacks certain abilities and requires premium for the majority of interactions

Current a WIP, made primarily for use within [SpotifyToDiscordBot](https://github.com/WhaleFromMars/PeopleBotKotlin)
Breaking changes will occur, make note of your used version. feel free to fork and do whatever, this is just a baseline.

Build with ```npm run build-local``` to produce a minified js version that you can place if your %appdata%/Spicetify/Extensions folder then run /spicetify apply from powershell/cmd on windows, check spicetify documentation for other platforms :)
